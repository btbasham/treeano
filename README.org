* treeano
This is currently a work in progress!
* Should I use this?
- Do you not know what a neural network is? Use [[http://scikit-learn.org/stable/][scikit-learn]].
- Do you want to use only the tried and tested elements of deep learning? Use [[http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/][Caffe]].
- Do you want to create novel architectures? Use [[https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne][Lasagne]].
- Do you want to create novel architectures that are inelegant to do in Lasagne? Use [[https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne][Lasagne]].
- Have you created these novel architectures that are inelegent to do in Lasagne? If you can live with it, keep using [[https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne][Lasagne]].
- Otherwise, maybe this is a good fit. (:
* Dependencies
- numpy
- theano
- networkx
- six
- toolz
- (optional) lasagne
* Dev dependencies
- nose
- sniffer
  - optional, to auto-run nosetests
* What's with the name?
- DAGano doesn't have the same ring to it
- architectures are constructed as immutable trees, and this allows you to customize the behavior of subtrees instead of manipulating a single global network
  - principle of locality: it's more likely that you'll want close-by nodes to behave similarly - thus having subnetworks makes sense
  - immutability is a good means of managing complexity - thus a tree makes sense
